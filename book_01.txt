                                LEADERSHIP


In every field of human endeavor, he that is first must perpetually live
in the white light of publicity. ¶Whether the leadership be vested in a
man or in a manufactured product, emulation and envy are ever at work.
¶In art, in literature, in music, in industry, the reward and the
punishment are always the same. ¶The reward is widespread recognition;
the punishment, fierce denial and detraction. ¶When a man’s work becomes
a standard for the whole world, it also becomes a target for the shafts
of the envious few. ¶If his work be merely mediocre, he will be left
severely alone—if he achieve a masterpiece, it will set a million
tongues a wagging. ¶Jealousy does not protrude its forked tongue at the
artist who produces a commonplace painting. ¶Whatsoever you write, or
paint, or play, or sing, or build, no one will strive to surpass or to
slander you, unless your work be stamped with the seal of genius. ¶Long,
long, after a great work, or a good work has been done, those who are
disappointed or envious, continue to cry out that it can not be done.
¶Spiteful little voices in the domain of art were raised against our own
Whistler as a mountebank, long after the big world had acclaimed him its
greatest artistic genius. ¶Multitudes flocked to Bayreuth to worship at
the musical shrine of Wagner, while the little group of those whom he
had dethroned and displaced, argued angrily that he was no musician at
all. ¶The little world continued to protest that Fulton could never
build a steamboat, while the big world flocked to the river banks to see
his boat steam by. ¶The leader is assailed because he is a leader, and
the effort to equal him is merely added proof of that leadership.
¶Failing to equal or to excel, the follower seeks to depreciate and to
destroy—but only confirms once more the superiority of that which he
strives to supplant. ¶There is nothing new in this. ¶It is as old as the
world and as old as the human passions—envy, fear, greed, ambition, and
the desire to surpass. ¶And it all avails nothing. ¶If the leader truly
leads, he remains—the leader. ¶Master-poet, master-painter,
master-workman, each in his turn is assailed, and each holds his laurels
through the ages. ¶That which is good or great makes itself known, no
matter how loud the clamor of denial. ¶That which deserves to
live—lives.

                              Announcement


The work of creating sentiment favorable to the establishment of a World
Court to judicially settle international disputes, now being undertaken
by the International Peace Forum, including the publication of the
“World Court,” involves considerable expense. New subscriptions to the
“World Court,” in addition to increasing its value and enlarging its
influence, will materially help out financially.

To-day, more than ever before, the voice of the people is for the
abolition of war. To this end plans are being formed and promulgated.
The contributions from the pens of able and influential writers in the
“World Court” will keep its readers in close touch with the work.

leads, he remains—the leader. ¶Master-poet, master-painter,
master-workman, each in his turn is assailed, and each holds his laurels
through the ages. ¶That which is good or great makes itself known, no
matter how loud the clamor of denial. ¶That which deserves to
live—lives.

In every field of human endeavor, he that is first must perpetually live
in the white light of publicity. ¶Whether the leadership be vested in a
man or in a manufactured product, emulation and envy are ever at work.
¶In art, in literature, in music, in industry, the reward and the
punishment are always the same. ¶The reward is widespread recognition;
the punishment, fierce denial and detraction. ¶When a man’s work becomes
a standard for the whole world, it also becomes a target for the shafts
of the envious few. ¶If his work be merely mediocre, he will be left
severely alone—if he achieve a masterpiece, it will set a million
tongues a wagging. ¶Jealousy does not protrude its forked tongue at the
artist who produces a commonplace painting. ¶Whatsoever you write, or
paint, or play, or sing, or build, no one will strive to surpass or to
slander you, unless your work be stamped with the seal of genius. ¶Long,
long, after a great work, or a good work has been done, those who are
disappointed or envious, continue to cry out that it can not be done.
¶Spiteful little voices in the domain of art were raised against our own
Whistler as a mountebank, long after the big world had acclaimed him its
greatest artistic genius. ¶Multitudes flocked to Bayreuth to worship at
the musical shrine of Wagner, while the little group of those whom he
had dethroned and displaced, argued angrily that he was no musician at
all. ¶The little world continued to protest that Fulton could never
build a steamboat, while the big world flocked to the river banks to see
his boat steam by. ¶The leader is assailed because he is a leader, and

The work of creating sentiment favorable to the establishment of a World
Court to judicially settle international disputes, now being undertaken
by the International Peace Forum, including the publication of the
“World Court,” involves considerable expense. New subscriptions to the
“World Court,” in addition to increasing its value and enlarging its
influence, will materially help out financially.

To-day, more than ever before, the voice of the people is for the
abolition of war. To this end plans are being formed and promulgated.
The contributions from the pens of able and influential writers in the
“World Court” will keep its readers in close touch with the work.

                              _The_
                                PENALTY OF
                                LEADERSHIP


In every field of human endeavor, he that is first must perpetually live
in the white light of publicity. ¶Whether the leadership be vested in a
man or in a manufactured product, emulation and envy are ever at work.
¶In art, in literature, in music, in industry, the reward and the
punishment are always the same. ¶The reward is widespread recognition;
the punishment, fierce denial and detraction. ¶When a man’s work becomes
a standard for the whole world, it also becomes a target for the shafts
of the envious few. ¶If his work be merely mediocre, he will be left
severely alone—if he achieve a masterpiece, it will set a million
tongues a wagging. ¶Jealousy does not protrude its forked tongue at the
artist who produces a commonplace painting. ¶Whatsoever you write, or
paint, or play, or sing, or build, no one will strive to surpass or to
slander you, unless your work be stamped with the seal of genius. ¶Long,
long, after a great work, or a good work has been done, those who are
disappointed or envious, continue to cry out that it can not be done.
¶Spiteful little voices in the domain of art were raised against our own
Whistler as a mountebank, long after the big world had acclaimed him its
greatest artistic genius. ¶Multitudes flocked to Bayreuth to worship at
the musical shrine of Wagner, while the little group of those whom he
had dethroned and displaced, argued angrily that he was no musician at
all. ¶The little world continued to protest that Fulton could never
build a steamboat, while the big world flocked to the river banks to see
his boat steam by. ¶The leader is assailed because he is a leader, and
the effort to equal him is merely added proof of that leadership.
¶Failing to equal or to excel, the follower seeks to depreciate and to
destroy—but only confirms once more the superiority of that which he
strives to supplant. ¶There is nothing new in this. ¶It is as old as the
world and as old as the human passions—envy, fear, greed, ambition, and
the desire to surpass. ¶And it all avails nothing. ¶If the leader truly
leads, he remains—the leader. ¶Master-poet, master-painter,
master-workman, each in his turn is assailed, and each holds his laurels
through the ages. ¶That which is good or great makes itself known, no
matter how loud the clamor of denial. ¶That which deserves to
live—lives.
